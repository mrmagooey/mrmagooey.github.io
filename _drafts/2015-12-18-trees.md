I'm going to go with a simple data structure for my Tree structure

{% highlight scheme %}

(bind-type Tree <!value,List{Tree*}*>)

{% endhighlight %}

Reading the type signature we have:

- Tree is a tuple with two elements
- The first element is a generic with name `value`
- The second element is a pointer to a List of pointers to Tree's

There are some common concepts that our tree needs to be able to represent.

- Root – The top node in a tree.
- Parent – The converse notion of a child.
- Siblings – Nodes with the same parent.
- Descendant – A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.
- Ancestor – A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
- Leaf – A node with no children.

With our representations

We represent like so:
